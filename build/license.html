<p>This software builds on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>Our code product does make use of some great open source  projects - and we are truly sorry not be to as generous nor as intelligent as they are.</p>
<p>It has become blasé industry policy to not give credit where it is due.  We appreciate your open source projects - and appreciate even more that you have allowed us to use them in such a way that does not stop the sale or sub licensing of commercial software,</p>
<p>We honestly invest to day it back.  To donate to each of these projects - wither in feedback, code, cash or developer love.  Where we cant pay it back - we will try and pay it forwards!</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong></p>
<p>We’ll be honest - we didn&#8217;t always love Microsoft.  But they deserve a special praise on 2 counts.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition</strong></p>
<p>Quite possible the best piece of IDE software ever written.  No more need for JetBrains - everything and enterprise develop needs (including GitHub team workflow is incorporated).  now its Free!</p>
<p>Than your Microsoft - you are now officially cool!</p>

<p>Open Sourcing of the .Net Framework
In October 2014 - Microsoft open sourced the .Net framework.  This will (already has) had massive implications for the future of C# as a language - and the common dream that we could have 1 programing framework for any task, on any device on any CPU architecture.</p>

<p><strong>The Open-Souring of Roslyn</strong></p>
<p>The open sourcing of Roslyn,  the core MSIL compiler makes for exciting future - such that logic from languages such as PHP, Python, Javascript, Ruby, C++, C, C+ and Java may one day be interoperable.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We honestly believe .Net may succeed Java as the future of universal programming.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>libwkhtmltox</strong></p>
<p>This LGLP project is incorporated into IronPDF as one of its HTML rendering gambits in an unmodified format.   It is great work, and provided inspiration for further development.</p>
<p>IronPDF uses this library fully within the LGPL3 license agreement - and respect the authors great work.</p>

<p><strong>PDFClown</strong></p>
<p>PDFClown is also an LGLP project, and is incorporated into IronPdf as on of our page-stamping gambits.  We love this library - and are awed at how smart Stefano Chizzolini is to simultaneously develop for Java and .Net</p>
<p>Again - here is his attribution citation:</p>

<p><strong>Special Thanks</strong></p>
<p>Thanks should also go to Slava Kolobaev and his work on the Pechkin PDF Interop for C# Project.</p>
<p>We were inspired by his clean C# architecture - and although out library does not use conventional Interop - he deserves a big thanks for sharing his design under CC Attribution license.</p>
<p>We wish we were as good at API design as you are!</p>
<p><strong>Adobe</strong></p>
<p>And Finally - Thank you adobe for opening up the PDF standard.  You have proven that openness in proprietary software is financially viable.</p>
