-----
This software isn't free for commercial usage or deployment .   Sorry, we work tirelessly to make the best software we can.

IronPDF is free for the developer:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use this software on your local lachine, test server and staging server for free.
If You are in a debugging evvironment - it will all work like magic.  You can show your boss, client and all is well.  if you are going to deploy to  a server or machine in production - a watermark will show on your PDFs.

I'm sure your clients and or empolyers will be happy to pay the license fees, as an alternative to the months of development it takes to build a PDF renderer of this quality.

---------------------------------

This software builds on the shoulders of giants.

Our code product does make use of some great open source  projects - and we are truly sorry not be to as generous nor as intelligent as they are.

It has become blasé industry policy to not give credit where it is due.  We appreciate your open source projects - and appreciate even more that you have allowed us to use them in such a way that does not stop the sale or sub licensing of commercial software,  We honestly invest to day it back.  To donate to each of these projects - wither in feedback, code, cash or developer love.  Where we cant pay it back - we will try and pay it forwards!  

Microsoft
^^^^^^^^^


We’ll be honest - we didn't always love Microsoft.  But they deserve a special praise on 2 counts.

  Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
************************************


Quite possible the best piece of IDE software ever written.  No more need for JetBrains - everything and enterprise develop needs (including GitHub team workflow is incorporated).  now its Free!    Than your Microsoft - you are now officially cool!  https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx   Open Sourcing of the .Net Framework In October 2014 - Microsoft open sourced the .Net framework.  This will (already has) had massive implications for the future of C# as a language - and the common dream that we could have 1 programing framework for any task, on any device on any CPU architecture.

The Open-Souring of Roslyn
***************************

The open sourcing of Roslyn,  the core MSIL compiler makes for exciting future - such that logic from languages such as PHP, Python, Javascript, Ruby, C++, C, C+ and Java may one day be interoperable.   We honestly believe .Net may succeed Java as the future of universal programming. 


libwkhtmltox

This LGLP project is incorporated into IronPDF as one of its HTML rendering gambits in an unmodified format.   It is great work, and provided inspiration for further development.

PDFClown

Special Thanks  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Thanks should also go to Slava Kolobaev and his work on the Pechkin PDF Interop for C# Project.
 We were inspired by his clean C# architecture - and although out library does not use conventional Interop - he deserves a big thanks for sharing his design under CC Attribution license.

We wish we were as good at API design as you are! 

 Adobe
^^^^^ 
And Finally - Thank you adobe for opening up the PDF standard.  You have proven that openness in proprietary software is financially viable.
