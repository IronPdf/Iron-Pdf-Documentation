IronPDF's core features are:

* Generating PDF documents from HTML as a string
* Generating PDF documents from Urls
* Rendering ASPX webforms as PDF documents on-the-fly

The base requirements are .Net framework 4.0 on the windows platform.

It works equally well in Forms Applications, Server Applications and Services, Web Applications, Secure Intranets, Console Apps, WPF Apps and MVC patterned websites.
