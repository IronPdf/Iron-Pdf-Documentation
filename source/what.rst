IronPDF is a commercial Grade PDF Generation library for the .Net platform, written in C#.

The key concept is to avoid time-consuming PDF generation APIs by rendering PDFs from HTML, CSS, Images and JavaScript.

IronPDF's core features are:

* Generating PDF documents from HTML as a string
* Generating PDF documents from Urls
* Rendering ASPX webforms as PDF documents on-the-fly

The base requirements are .Net framework 4.0 on the windows platform.

It works equally well in Forms Applications, Server Applications and Services, Web Applications, Secure Intranets, Console Apps, WPF Apps and MVC patterned websites.

  IronPDF doesn't try to render HTML.  It actually print up an instance of a real standard compliant web browser behind the scenes (without any additional software needing to be installed).  

The HTML gets rendered with complete accuracy - and in a vector format suitable for the highest standards of commercial printing.

* Just make it look right in HTML - and then use IronPDF output your PDF as a file, stream or byte array.
* Full IntelliSense documentation which even includes embedded code examples.

* CSS3, HTML5 and Javascript compliance.
* Real, standards compliant HTML rendering and pixel perfect PDF conversion with vector and font support.
